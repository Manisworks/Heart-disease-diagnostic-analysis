##Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis with Power BI
This repository showcases a Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis project using Power BI and Excel. The goal is to visualize and analyze heart disease data for better insights into patient risk factors and trends.

##Features
Data Preparation: Utilize Excel to clean and preprocess heart disease datasets, including handling missing values and data transformations.
Power BI Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics, trends, and correlations in heart disease data.
Visual Analytics: Implement pie charts, graphs, and slicers to represent data intuitively, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
Insights Sharing: Easily share and collaborate on findings through Power BI service.
Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel
Power BI
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Power Query

##Heart Disease Prevalence: (Insights)-

*48.7% of individuals are diagnosed with heart disease, while 51.3% are not.
 ST Depression:

*Males exhibit a higher incidence of ST depression compared to females.
 Age and Heart Disease:

*Middle-aged individuals are more commonly affected by heart disease, while older individuals are less likely to experience it.
 Gender Disparity in Heart Disease:

*Males are at a greater risk of developing heart disease compared to females.
 Chest Pain and Heart Disease Risk:

*Individuals with Typical Angina (a specific type of chest pain) face a significantly higher likelihood of heart disease.
 A larger proportion of men experience Typical Angina than women.
 The prevalence of Typical Angina is notably higher among the elderly population.
 Trends in Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:

*Blood pressure tends to rise between the ages of 50 and 60, with this trend often continuing into the 70s.
 Similarly, cholesterol levels increase within the same age range and persist through the 70s.
 ST Depression and Age:

*ST depression predominantly increases in individuals aged 30â€“40, which is associated with a heightened risk of heart disease.
